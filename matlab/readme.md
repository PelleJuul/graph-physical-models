# Graph Physical Models: Matlab implementation

This folder contains a Matlab implementation of *graph physical models*. For a
quick start try one of the examples:

* *GraphBars.m* undampened stiff linear bar.
* *GraphBarsDampened.m* dampened stiff linear bar.
* *GraphStrings.m* undampened stiff string.
* *GraphStringsDampened.m* dampened stiff string.

If you which to look closer into the implementation have a look at
*GraphModel.m* which implements the branching difference operators introduced
in the paper.
